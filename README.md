# brgvos-installer
BRGV-OS Linux installer implemented in GNU Bash.  
[BRGV-OS](https://github.com/florintanasa/brgvos-void) is a spin Void Linux distribution.  

The brgvos-installer installer is a spin of the Void Linux installer to which we have made some changes and added new
features.  

Its main function is to install the BRGV-OS live system, located on the CD, as well as to install a minimal functional
system (base system) of Void Linux together with kernel6.12.
